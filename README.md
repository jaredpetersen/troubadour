# Troubadour
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaredpetersen/troubadour.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaredpetersen/troubadour)

Troubadour is wrapper over command-line audio players that makes it easy to play audio in Node.js. At this point, the following audio players are supported:
* MPlayer
* Sox
* VLC

Other audio players can easily be added by adding entries into the `supportedAudioPlayers.json` file.

## Installation
```
npm install troubadour
```
Since Troubadour uses command-line audio players to facilitate audio playback, you will also need to install one of the supported players.

## Usage
### Getting Started
To get started, require the module in your program and create a new Troubadour instance by passing the name of the supported audio player into the constructor.

```javascript
const Troubadour = require('troubadour');
const troubadour = new Troubadour('sox');
```

Troubadour is an [event emitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) that indicates when certain actions are being performed by the audio player. The following code snippet shows how to add an event listener to your new `troubadour` player.

```javascript
troubadour.on('eventname', () => {
  // Event listener function
});
```

You do not need to have listeners set up in order to use Troubadour but they provide a programmatic way of defining actions that you would like to take when the audio playback starts, pauses, stops, resumes, ends, and errors.

### Play
To play an audio source, use the `play` function and pass in the file path of the audio source that is to be played:

```javascript
troubadour.on('start', () => {
  // Do something here when the audio starts playing
});

troubadour.on('end', () => {
  // Do something here when the audio finishes playing
});

troubadour.play('~/Music/audiofile.mp3');
```

### Pause
Pause the playback (with the ability to resume later) by using the `pause` function:

```javascript
troubadour.on('pause', () => {
  // Do something here when the audio is paused
});

troubadour.pause();
```

### Stop
Stop the playback (without the ability to resume later) by using the `stop` function:

```javascript
troubadour.on('stop', () => {
  // Do something here when the audio is paused
});

troubadour.stop();
```

### Resume
Resume the playback from a paused state by using the `resume` function:

```javascript
troubadour.on('resume', () => {
  // Do something here when the audio is resumed
});

troubadour.resume();
```

### Errors
Troubadour handles errors in two different ways: abruptly throwing an error when the error is not recoverable or gracefully emitting the error when it is recoverable.

Errors like not passing the name of a supported command-line audio player to the Troubadour constructor are not recoverable, so the module will throw an error. Errors like calling the `play` function without specifying a file path are recoverable, so Troubadour will just emit an error event to let the user know.

The error listener can be set up by including the following:

```javascript
troubadour.on('error', (error) => {
  // Do something here to handle the errors
});
```

The `error` parameter in the callback listener function is an error object. Just like any error object, accessing the error message can be done through `error.message`.
